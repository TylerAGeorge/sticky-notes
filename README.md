# sticky notes
 An application created to organize notes as one would on a physical board.

On the canvas, notes can be moved around by clicking and dragging on them. To delete a note, click the *X* icon on the upper right hand side of the note.

# how to run
 To run the project, open a command terminal in the main project folder. Then, execute *dotnet run* in the terminal. If that fails, run *dotnet build* and try *dotnet run* again.
